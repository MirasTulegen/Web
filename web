    <h1 style="position: relative;text-align: center;">WHAT I LOVE TO DO!?</h1>
    <p style="position: relative; left: 3%;width: 97%;">Of all the variety of hobbies, my hobby is books. When I start reading, I give all of myself and I can sit reading some interesting book almost all day, forgetting about sleep and food. When I read, I calm down.

Reading, I get to know myself, create my own reality. One book is reality. And I have already accumulated a lot of them.

Love for books is the merit of Parents. I still remember the day when they gave me my first book - the wizard of the emerald city. I really enjoyed reading and my parents bought me new books.

Now, I have already gathered a whole collection of books. They fill my entire room. Books gave me not only happy moments, but also good studies at school, because reading, I develop. </p>
